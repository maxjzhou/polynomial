# polynomial
This program performs addition/multiplication operations on two polynomials to evaluate a polynomial expression. The polynomials will be read from an input stream (i.e. text file). A few examples can be cound in the "testcases" folder.

To run this program, run Polytest.java

When run, the program will first prompt the user for a polynomial file:

	Enter the name of the polynomial file =>
        
The polynomial expression represented by the file will be printed. The user is then prompted to enter a number (1 through 4). These numbers correspond to command:

	1. ADD polynomial
	2. MULTIPLY polynomial
	3. EVALUATE polynomial
	4. QUIT
	Enter choice # => 
        
Afterwards, the program will prompt the user for another polynomial file before printing the solution.
